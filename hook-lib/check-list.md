## Things to check and study

1. Do I ever need 'dependency' for library? 
   1. 'dev dependency' for development of the library
   2. 'peer depedency' for the library user

2. Types
   1. what is 'types' in package.json
      - if 'files' are declared, no need to add 'types' to package.json
      - it will look for index.d.ts in files folder
      - still good practice to have 'types' in package.json
   2. don't need @types at the moment

3. Plugins
   - Should learn about roll up plugins
     - how babel plugin works
     - how typescript plugin works

4. How tree-shaking works with rollup?
